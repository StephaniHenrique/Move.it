  Move.it
</h1>

The project in question was developed during the fourth NLW (Next Level Week). The application aims to assist developers who work for hours without interruptions for rest or exercise. Putting the Pomodoro method into practice, the software counts 25 minutes of work being released at the end of each cycle a challenge that involves exercising the muscles or eyes. To encourage you to meet the challenges, there is a reward system in which the user can level up by increasing his XP.
